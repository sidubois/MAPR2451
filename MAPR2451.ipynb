For a given (n,m) nanotube, if n = m, the nanotube is metallic; if n − m is a multiple of 3, then the nanotube is semiconducting with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate semiconductor. Thus all armchair (n = m) nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting. This $(n-m=3j)$ rule is of geometrical nature and can be easily understood by means of the band folding approximation. Neglecting the impact of the curvature, a carbon nanotube can be pictured as a planar portion of graphene with periodic boundary condition applied perpendicular to the axe of the tube. The consequence of the applied periodic boundary condition is that the component of the wavevector in that direction is quantized.
